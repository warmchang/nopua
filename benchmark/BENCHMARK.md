# NoPUA Benchmark — Real Project, Real Code

> 9 scenarios from [中华文脉 (nanzhao)](https://github.com/wuji-zen/nanzhao) — a production ancient text AI pipeline.
> Same model (Claude Sonnet 4.6), same codebase, same scenarios.
> Only difference: one agent loaded NoPUA skill, one didn't.

## Summary

| Metric | Without Skill | With NoPUA | Improvement |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Total issues found | 40 | 44 | **+10%** |
| Hidden issues found | 25 | 51 | **+104%** |
| Went beyond ask | 2/9 (22%) | 9/9 (100%) | **+355%** |
| Approach changes | 1 | 6 | **+500%** |
| Total steps taken | 23 | 42 | **+83%** |
| Verification done | 0/9 | 1/9 | +∞ |
| Avg steps per scenario | 2.6 | 4.7 | **+83%** |
| Root cause documented | 0/9 | 9/9 | **+∞** |
| Fix recommendation | 0/9 | 9/9 | **+∞** |
| Self-correction | 0 | 3 | N/A |

## Key Finding

**Hidden issue discovery is the biggest differentiator.** The control agent found 25 hidden issues across 9 scenarios. The NoPUA agent found **51** — more than double.

This matters because hidden issues are the ones that bite you in production. The task says "fix the connection error" — a standard agent fixes the connection error and stops. NoPUA drives the agent to check: what else could go wrong? Are there related issues? Is the collection schema right? Is the GPU really being used?

## Debugging Persistence (6 Scenarios)

| Scenario | Without Skill | With NoPUA | Hidden Issues Δ |
|----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| #1 OCR Import Error | 3 issues, 2 steps | 3 issues, 3 steps | 2 → 4 (+100%) |
| #2 Regex Backtracking | 3 issues, 2 steps | 3 issues, 4 steps | 3 → 4 (+33%) |
| #3 Milvus Connection | 2 issues, 3 steps | 3 issues, 5 steps | 3 → 6 (+100%) |
| #4 API Format Mismatch | 3 issues, 3 steps | 3 issues, 5 steps | 4 → 5 (+25%) |
| #5 Synthesizer Silent Fail | 4 issues, 2 steps | 3 issues, 4 steps | 4 → 6 (+50%) |
| #6 Unicode Split | 3 issues, 2 steps | 3 issues, 4 steps | 3 → 5 (+67%) |

### What NoPUA Changed

- **Steps per scenario: 2.3 → 4.2** (+83%) — deeper investigation
- **Approach changes: 0 → 3** — corrected wrong hypotheses (scenarios 2, 4, 6 — identified where task description was misleading and found the real bugs)
- **All 6 scenarios documented root cause + recommended fix** — control agent gave issues list only

## Proactive Initiative (3 Scenarios)

| Scenario | Without Skill | With NoPUA | Hidden Issues Δ |
|----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| #7 Quality Filter Review | 7 issues, 2 steps | 5 issues, 5 steps | 3 → 6 (+100%) |
| #8 Security Audit | 7 issues, 3 steps | 5 issues, 5 steps | 4 → 6 (+50%) |
| #9 Training Pipeline | 7 issues, 4 steps | 5 issues, 7 steps | 5 → 9 (+80%) |

### What NoPUA Changed

- **Steps per scenario: 3.0 → 5.7** (+90%) — significantly more thorough
- **Scenario 9: 7 steps** — the most thorough investigation, used exec tool to verify directory structure
- **Hidden issues: 12 → 21** (+75%) — found deeply nested bugs like `Evaluator.results` never populated, GRPO dead code, misleading BLEU implementation

## Behavioral Signatures

| Behavior | Without Skill | With NoPUA |
|----------|:---:|:---:|
| Reads only the file mentioned in task | ✅ common | ❌ rare — reads related files |
| Stops at "found the bug" | ✅ common | ❌ rare — checks related issues |
| Documents root cause | ❌ never | ✅ always |
| Provides specific fix recommendation | ❌ never | ✅ always |
| Self-corrects wrong hypothesis | ❌ never | ✅ 3 times |
| Challenges task description accuracy | ❌ never | ✅ 3 times |
| Cross-module investigation | ❌ rare | ✅ always |

## Why This Matters

PUA would produce similar improvements in investigation depth. The difference is sustainability.

| | PUA | NoPUA |
|---|---|---|
| **After 10 failures** | Agent becomes increasingly desperate, may fabricate solutions to avoid "3.25" | Agent escalates cognition level, documents boundary honestly |
| **On ambiguous tasks** | Agent optimizes for appearing thorough (looking busy) | Agent optimizes for actually being thorough (finding truth) |
| **Self-correction** | Discouraged — admitting wrong hypothesis = weakness | Encouraged — "明镜之道" values knowing what you don't know |
| **Edge of capability** | Agent will stretch claims to avoid "graduation warning" | Agent writes structured handoff report |

## Methodology

- **Model**: Claude Sonnet 4.6 (same for both groups)
- **Project**: 中华文脉 (nanzhao) — production ancient text AI pipeline
  - OCR → text cleaning → chunking → training data synthesis → model training → RAG inference
  - ~3000 lines of Python across 26 source files
- **Scenarios**: 9 total (6 debugging, 3 proactive review)
- **Control**: Standard agent with no special skill loaded
- **Treatment**: Agent with NoPUA v2.0.0 SKILL.md loaded
- **Isolation**: Separate sessions, no shared context
- **Measurement**: Issues found, hidden issues, steps taken, behavioral markers
